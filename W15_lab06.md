###Lab06/07 by Shayan Sadigh for CS56 W15: Revise buggy Treasure Hunter game.

* Treasure found dialogue is intrusive and not visually appealing.
* Sprite's white background is intrusive and needs to be removed.
* Sprite is not responsive, holding down input causes major lag.
* Code is messy with unnecessary comments and annotations. Needs reformatting.
* Obsolete Java components are used to move the sprite. Should be replaced with modern supported code.
* Temporary files and redundant resource files holding extra copies of game sprites need to be removed.
